# Hackthebox - Monteverde

## Summary

Monteverde,a Windows box created by HackTheBox user `egre55`, was an overall medium difficulty box. Initial foothold was finding a cred which was a result of a lazy sysadmin. using that we can find credentials for user in a ```azure.xml``` file. checking the group of that user we see it is in Azure Admin group which mean it can perform DCSync using that we can get administrator credentials and pwned this box.

```
we see all the ports are `Active Directory` and `SMB` related

running `emum4linux` we get a list of usernames.

using that we can create a `users.txt` as
```
Guest
AAD_987d7f2f57d2
mhope
SABatchJobs
svc-ata
svc-bexec
svc-netapp
dgalanos
roleary
smorgan
```
` crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.172 -u users.txt -p users.txt`

Trying the same username as password we get a successful credential as `SABatchJobs:SABatchJobs`

Trying that on `winrm` we get `Invalid credential` so lets try on `smb`, and Bingo

we can list and Read lot of shares checking //10.10.10.172/users$ share we see there is a `azure.xml` in `mhope` directory
```

```
which contain the password as `4n0therD4y@n0th3r$` for `mhope`.

Trying that with [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) we get a shell as mhope using that we can grab users.txt as `4961976bd7d8f4eeb2ce3705e2f212f2`

## Privilege Escalation

Taking a look to the privileges of this user you can find that it is a member of the group Azure Admins

which means we can do DCSync.

Reading about any exploits for Azure Admin Sync we stumble upon [xpnsec](https://blog.xpnsec.com/about/) [blog](https://blog.xpnsec.com/azuread-connect-for-redteam/)

Performing the attack is as easy as downloading the PS1 [script](https://github.com/Hackplayers/PsCabesha-tools/blob/master/Privesc/Azure-ADConnect.ps1) and executing that.

```
Domain: MEGABANK.LOCAL
Username: administrator
Password: d0m@in4dminyeah!
```

and we have credential for administrator using that we can grab root.txt as `12909612d25c8dcf6e5a07d1a804a0bc`
and we have pwned MonteverdeðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ
