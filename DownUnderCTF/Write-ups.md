### Solution
When you connect to the machine a bounch of messages are displayed and you can not execute any command. I tried to `scp` the whole home directory, but the script that displayed the messages on ssh connection was throwing some error. Looking more closely, the flag is displayed among the other messages.

### Solution
I have no idea about baseball, but I know that the string looks like encoding and it's not base 16 (hex). Base64 deconding it gives us the flag.

### Solution
We get a `.wav` file and, as the title suggest, we might find the flag in the spectogram. For viewing it I used [Sonic Visualizer](https://sonicvisualiser.org/). I played a little with the settings to view it better.
